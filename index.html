    <p class="sectionSubTag textSmall">We publish a monthly newsletter, Tiresia in which we include 
        interview of prominent persons under a section called tete-a-tete. India is witnessing an 
        enormous upsurge in the number of youth taking up varied fields as their career. Considering the 
        experience of the renowned personalities, their interview inspires and guides the youth very much. 
        Based upon the convenience, it can be an email interview or a video call interview. In case of 
        email interview, we send the questions to the concerned authority via email after which they can 
        send the answers. 
        In case of video interview, we use any of the interfaces upon mutual consideration. We 
         also send a copy of our newsletter Tiresia after it is published. This section of Tiresia is 
         very interesting and informative at the same time. </p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag textSmall">Vagmita is an open for all poetry recitation event, which 
        involves astonishing and creative use of literary devices, all in a bundle of lines. The 
        participant is supposed to e-mail us their entries through gmail. The video should comprise 
        the student reciting any poem that is either self-composed or that of any renowned poet. The 
        event brings out the hidden potential of many students who have the talent, but are hesitant 
        to showcase it due to the lack of pertinent opportunities or camera consciousness. It focuses 
        on literary, as well the oratory skills, expressions, dialogue-delivery, etc. qualities of a 
        student.</p>
